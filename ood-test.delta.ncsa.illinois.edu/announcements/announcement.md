- For general Open OnDemand information, please see [the Open OnDemand section of the Delta User Guide](https://docs.ncsa.illinois.edu/systems/delta/en/latest/user_guide/ood/index.html).
- While development in Jupyter can be done in the -interactive partitions (with 1 hour wall clock limit), longer running Jupyter sessions need to use the standard partitions (up to 48 hour wall clock limits).  You can find [a list of all available Slurm partitions on Delta](https://docs.ncsa.illinois.edu/systems/delta/en/latest/user_guide/running_jobs.html#delta-production-partitions-queues) in the Delta User Guide.
